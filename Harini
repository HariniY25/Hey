Hello everyone
my name is Y Harini.Im a 18 years old student studying BTech 1st year. 
In today's session I learnt many things like front-end and back end applications, I wrote an exam and today's class was interesting and made me think of attending more classes.
About front-end- it is an application which is the first page of a website.
Front end gives a request to the Middleware through the API and Middleware checks the application whether it is correct ot wrong.
After this the application is sent to the controller and this takes the data from the database through the driver and by this the controller gives response to the application 
This the communication between the front-end and database.
Here tha bridge between front-end and Middleware is API and the bridge between application and database is the driver.
Thank you
